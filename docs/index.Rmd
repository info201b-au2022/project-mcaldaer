```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Summary paragraph: 
``` {r}
source("../source/summary.R")
interactions
```

Here is where we will write a summary paragraph that includes values calculated in the summary.R file. Lets test it out 

We found that the Terry Stops dataset showed there were 5 types of interactions 

`r interactions`

## Table of Summary Information
``` {r}
source("../source/table.R")
```

## Chart 1: Bar Chart
``` {r}
source("../source/barchart.R")
```

## Chart 2: Pie Chart
``` {r}
source("../source/piechart.R")
```
`r pie_chart`

## Chart 3: Map
``` {r}
source("../source/map.R")
register_google(key = "AIzaSyA6IXtNTqQSNjxLG0vcFgct5eHOChp5MNw")
# map_fatality
```
`r map_fatality`
`r map_race`
`r map_justified`

This visualization seeks to geographically plot the most extreme form of police violence, _Officer Involved Shootings_. This plot was included because it allows us to visualize where in Seattle shootings have occurred. While it would have been valuable to plot the geographical distribution of all the of the interactions we are analyzing (Terry Stops and Use of Force, too), the Officer Involved Shootings (OIS) dataset was the only set that included detailed location data. The longitude and latitude points included in the OIS dataset made for straightforward plotting. 

By plotting these 156 instances of OIS on a map of Seattle, one can observe that a large 
cluster of shootings occurred in the city center, in Downtown and the surrounding areas. 
One can also observe the noticeable absence of shootings in North Seattle neighborhoods 
like Ballard, Fremont, Magnolia and Queen Anne as well as the neighborhood of Madison Park. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these are some of the wealthier (and whiter) neighborhoods in the city. 


<!-- ## What is this file for? -->

<!-- * This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis. -->

<!-- * Please see Canvas for more details. -->

<!-- ## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY -->
<!-- ### Example 1: Source some code and run a function -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one -->
<!-- # directory(..), down into source (/source), and  -->
<!-- # then "source" an R file (data_access.R) -->
<!-- source("../source/data_access.R") -->
<!-- data_access_test() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Example 1: This function was "sourced" above -->
<!-- msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- > `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!  -->

<!-- ## ABOUT THIS FILE:  -->

<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
