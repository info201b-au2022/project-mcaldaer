***Code name:*** SAMI

***Project title:***

***Authors:*** Madeleine Clarke, Allison Huang, Sean Kim, Ivy Li

***Affiliation:*** INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington

***Date:*** Autumn 2022

***Abstract:*** Write a short abstract of three sentences. Your abstract should summarize your entire project, but only the very most important aspects. Here are two examples of how you might structure your abstract: **(1)** "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." and **(2)** "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." |

***Keywords:*** 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.  (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data")

***Introduction:*** Briefly introduce your project. (About 150 words.)

***Problem Domain:*** Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (About 400 words.)

***Research Questions:*** Present your 3-5 research questions.  You should present each research question.  For each research question, you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions you would write about 200 words or more if needed.)

***The Dataset:*** **(1)** Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? **(4)** Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure?  Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.)

**(4) Provenance of Dataset:**

***Expected Implications:*** Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.)

***Limitations:*** Proposal only. What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (About 150 words.)
