    p("The goal of our project was to examine data from the Seattle Police Department and produce visualizations about the police interactions in Seattle and their correlation with race and geography. 
      Our research questions were 'What kinds of interactions or violence occur between police and civilians? What are the most common ones?', 'How are police interactions in Seattle distributed across race and gender? Does it align with the general demographics? Or is there any bias?', and 'How are police interactions in Seattle distributed geographically across the city? Does it align with the general demographics? Or is there any bias?'. 
      From the bar chart that shows the distribution of race involved in different types, we were able to find out that the proportion of black people involved in Use of Force is much larger than that in general demographics. 
      Moreover, the race that is involved the most in level 3, the highest level of force, was Black or African American. 
      This gives an idea to our first and second research question. 
      The answer to the first research question would be level 1 Use of Force which is force that causes transitory pain or the complaint of transitory pain. 
      With the findings from the bar chart, the second question could also be answered partially. 
      White and black people are the major races involved in police interactions, and it does not align with the general demographics as the proportion of black people much larger than the general demographics as stated above. 
      From the pie chart that displays the perceived races of the people that are stopped by police, we were able to find out that people of the perceived race of White is the group that is stopped the most by police. 
      This pie chart gave us a complete answer to the second question, which was partially answered by the bar chart. 
      For the White people, the groups seem to correspond, with the group being the largest demographic in Seattle, and also being the group that recieves the most interactions from the police regardless of the type of interaction. 
      However, it did not align with black people. 
      29.71% of black people was stopped by police, 36.1% of black people encountered use of force by officers, while they only compose of 7.06% of the population of the city of Seattle. 
      From our last chart, the map that plots the most extreme form of police violence Officer Involved Shootings, we were able to find out that  a large cluster of shootings occurred in the city center, in Downtown Seattle and the surrounding areas. 
      We also observed that shootings lacked in North Seattle like Ballard, Fremont, Magnolia and Queen Anne as well as the neighborhood of Madison Park. 
      These findings gave us answer to our last question. 
      The distribution of police interactions in Seattle does not align with the general demographics, as there was absence of shootings in some of the wealthier neighborhoods in the city.

    p("The data from the Seattle Police Department is significant as it consists
      of various types of interactions that officers have with civilians, and 
      the patterns that have been revealed are helpful for understanding which 
      groups of people are disproportionately affected. Furthermore, those trends
      will then be helpful for policymakers and officials to implement new policies 
      and plans that will help create greater equality of treatment by police 
      officers toward the civilians. Analyzing the datasets, it is clear that 
      there are different treatments against people of different backgrounds. 
      For example, people of certain racial groups receive interactions from 
      the police, regardless of which type of interaction it is (police terry 
      stops, officer-involved shooting, uses of force), 
      much more than people of other backgrounds. Specifically, 
      in these datasets, it would be the White people and Black people. 
      However, it is important to note the differences in these two pieces 
      of data, as the White people being the most corresponds to the general
      demographics; on the other hand, for the Black people, their percentage 
      of them facing police interactions is much greater than that of the 
      percentage in the general demographics. With such revealing disparities
      in treatments toward people of different backgrounds, this could also 
      mean that there are trends in how officers within the Seattle Police 
      Department operate on their job, and could be of concern and if 
      necessary, would need to be looked into or have new policies created 
      so that they perform with less bias towards different groups of people. 
      The geographical distributions of the data is also notable, as it 
      reveals potential connections to other factors of each neighborhood 
      and community, including racial factors and if the interactions by 
      the police were justified, and could help researchers and policymakers 
      alike focus on what policies should be put into place in order to 
      lessen interactions in areas that have much more occurrences than 
      other places."),
    p("Overall, the data from the Seattle Police Department is very 
      helpful and reveals many noticeable trends that can be looked into 
      in order to create more equality in regards to police interactions with 
      civilians in the city of Seattle, WA. Although the datasets include many 
      variables and is quite complex so good analysis can be performed on them, 
      a limitation of the dataset is that much of it is self-reported by the 
      officers of the SPD themselves, which can lead to issues of bias. 
      As the datasets chosen focus on interactions that occur in Seattle,
      it would be interesting to compare the findings with other cities 
      and locations, and even on a larger scale of the entire country, 
      as there would be more implications that arise. Those trends, 
      then can once again, help with the creation of new policies to 
      reduce bias and increase equality in police interactions with 
      civilians of different backgrounds."),
