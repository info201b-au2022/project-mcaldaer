## Findings from data in tables

Table 1: For gender, males got stopped the most.

Table 2: White and black got stopped the most. This could mean a bias of police towards black people.

Table 3: North and West got the most people stopped. It could mean these two areas are not as safe as other areas.

Table 4: For interactions, field contact is the most.
